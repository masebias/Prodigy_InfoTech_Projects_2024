
Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. 

You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel and decrypt images.

key = 50

#In the given code context, the line key = 50 assigns the integer value 50 to the variable key. 
#This variable key is then utilized as a parameter in the encryption and decryption functions subsequently defined in the code. 
#The value assigned to key serves as the encryption/decryption key. 
    #In this code, it implies that the encryption and decryption processes in the code are based 
        #on a straightforward additive cipher where each pixel value in the image is shifted by 50 units 
        #(using modulo 256 arithmetic) during encryption and reverted by the same amount during decryption. 
#Altering the value of key would consequently alter the encryption and decryption process.  
    #For instance, utilizing a different value such as key = 25 would yield a distinct encryption/decryption scheme.
